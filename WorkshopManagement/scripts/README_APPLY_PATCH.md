How to apply the production patch bundle (Option C)

- Prereqs: Git, a local clone of SupatronixWarehouse, and your patch ZIP (supatronix-prod-final.zip).
- Steps:
 1) Build the patch ZIP using the script (if not already):
     bash tools/make-prod-zip.sh
 2) Run the apply script (with optional parameters):
     bash scripts/apply-prod-patch.sh --branch prod-prod-final --dry-run
 3) If the dry run looks good, run without --dry-run to apply:
     bash scripts/apply-prod-patch.sh --branch prod-prod-final
 4) Push and open PR manually:
     git push -u origin prod-prod-final
     Create PR against main with the PR body from docs/PR_BODY_FINAL.md and reference docs/RELEASE_NOTES_FINAL.md

- Outputs:
  - Patch applied to working tree and committed on the specified branch
  - A downloadable ZIP is generated by the patch tool (supatronix-prod-final.zip)
